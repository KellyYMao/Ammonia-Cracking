# Overview
Ammonia-Cracking is a process in which gaseous ammonia (NH3) dissociates into nitrogen gas (N2) and hydrogen gas (H2). Ammonia-cracking is a cost-effective process way to produce hydrogen gas. The hydrogen gas obtained from ammonia-cracking can have many uses in oil refineries and thus finding ways to streamline ammonia-cracking is important. 

# Ammonia-Cracking Reaction
The reaction for gaseous ammonia decomposition is 2NH3(g) = N2(g) + 3H2(g). This is 
an endothermic reaction. 

# Project Purpose
This project uses Python in order to calculate the partial pressures of ammonia gas, nitrogen gas, and hydrogen gas (product and reactants of gaseous ammonia decomposition) at various temperatures and pressures. Graphs demonstrating the effect of temperature and pressure on the respective mole fractions of ammonia gas, nitrogen gas, and hydrogen gas were plotted in Python using matplotlib. From these graphs the effects of increased temperature and increased pressure on ammonia decomposition were analyzed and conclusions were made on how to potentially increase the yield and efficiency of ammonia cracking.
