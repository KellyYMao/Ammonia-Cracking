# Ammonia-Cracking
# This project focuses on the thermodynamic chemistry of ammonia cracking. 
# Graphs were plotted in Python using matplotlib to demonstrate the effect of increased temperature and pressure on the mole fractions of the reactants and products of gaseous ammonia decomposition. 
# The effects of increased temperature and increased pressure on ammonia decomposition were analyzed and conclusions were made on how to potentially increase the yield and efficiency of ammonia cracking.
